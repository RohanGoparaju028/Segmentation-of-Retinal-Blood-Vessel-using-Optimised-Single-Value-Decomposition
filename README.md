# Segmentation of Retinal Blood Vessels Using Optimized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Overview

This project focuses on the automated segmentation of retinal blood vessels using an optimized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach implemented in **MATLAB**. The system is designed to assist in the **early detection of diabetic retinopathy** by identifying abnormalities such as blood vessel blockages and potential blood clots in retinal fundus images.

Early and accurate vessel segmentation is a critical step in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy and preventing vision loss in diabetic patients.

## Problem Statement

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness, and early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Manual inspection of retinal images is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the process by enhancing and segmenting retinal blood vessels, enabling early identification of pathological changes such as vessel narrowing and clot formation.
